# 🔐 Zama Compliance Hook – Part 2  

### Architecture, Bitmapped Conditions, and FHE-Hashed Eligibility for RWA Trading and USD Redemption on Uniswap v4

In [Part 1](https://medium.com/coinmonks/trading-real-world-assets-on-uniswap-with-homomorphic-encryption-51c67dd9d318), we introduced a vision: enabling decentralized trading of real-world assets (RWAs) like gold, stocks, and real estate — directly on Uniswap — with regulatory compliance and privacy by design.

This second part dives into the technical framework that makes it possible — **not only to buy RWAs** securely, but also to **redeem them for USD** instantly and compliantly.

This second part dives into the technical implementation using:

- 🧩 Modular smart contract architecture  
- 🧠 Rule/condition encoding using bitmaps  
- 🔐 Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) by Zama  
- 🔏 On-chain storage of **FHE-hashed user data only**  
- 🧪 A working example with pseudocode for Stock X  

---

## 👥 User Roles

### Compliance Expert
- Creates and publishes regulatory rules per jurisdiction
- Encodes them as condition bitmaps (`uint256`)
- Assigns rules to tokenized assets (Products)

### Investor (User)
- Completes off-chain KYC/AML with a licensed verifier
- Verifier encrypts and hashes the compliance profile using **Zama FHE**
- **Only the FHE-encrypted hash** is stored on-chain in the User Registry

## 💡 Why USD Redemption Matters

One major limitation of traditional RWA platforms is slow, manual fiat redemptions — often taking days or even weeks.

**This architecture introduces a breakthrough:**

> 🧾 **Privacy-first compliance checks + instant USD redemption**

### ✅ How it works:

- User submits a redemption request (RWA → USD)
- FHE Verifier runs a **Zama-powered compliance check**
- If compliant, the system executes an **atomic swap**:
  - Burn RWA tokens
  - Mint USDC on the user's wallet (via Circle or equivalent)

### 🚀 Benefits:

- No wait times  
- No centralized delays  
- Full privacy for users  
- Compliance enforced without exposing data  
- Fully on-chain settlement path

---

## 🧠 Architecture Highlights

- **Rules** define compliance via bitmaps (age, jurisdiction, AML, etc.)
- **Products** list the rules required for eligibility
- **Users** upload FHE-hashed compliance proofs
- **Hooks** can enforce these rules before allowing trades or redemptions
- **Circle/Fiat Bridge** performs atomic issuance of USDC after compliance pass

## 🔐 Compliance with FHE Hashing

- Users never store raw compliance data on-chain.
- Instead, off-chain verifiers hash encrypted bitmaps using Zama FHE.
- Only the encrypted hash is uploaded to the blockchain.
- Eligibility checks are done by comparing user hashes with rule bitmaps — all encrypted.

## 🧠 Example: Bitmap Encoding (For Illustration Only)

| Bits       | Condition Description                      |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 0–3        | Nationality (e.g., Egyptian = 0001)         |
| 4          | Age > 18 (1 = true)                         |
| 5–6        | AML recency (e.g., 01 = <6 months)          |
| 7          | Investor Accreditation                     |
| 8–12       | National ID Checksum                        |
| 13–15      | Jurisdiction (e.g., 101 = MENA)             |

## 💾 Solidity Interfaces

### `IRule.sol`

```solidity
interface IRule {
    function getConditionBitmap() external view returns (uint256);
}
```

### `IProduct.sol`

```solidity
interface IProduct {
    function getRuleAddresses() external view returns (address[] memory);
    function addRule(address ruleAddress) external;
}
```

### `IRulesEngine.sol`

```solidity
interface IRulesEngine {
    function isCompliant(address user, address product) external view returns (bool);
}
```

### `IFHEVerifier.sol`

```solidity
interface IFHEVerifier {
    function verifyUserAgainstRules(bytes calldata encryptedUserHash, uint256[] calldata ruleBitmaps) external view returns (bool);
}
```

## 🛠 RulesEngine Contract Example

```solidity
contract RulesEngine is IRulesEngine {
    IUserRegistry public registry;
    IFHEVerifier public verifier;

    constructor(address _registry, address _verifier) {
        registry = IUserRegistry(_registry);
        verifier = IFHEVerifier(_verifier);
    }

    function isCompliant(address user, address product) public view override returns (bool) {
        address[] memory ruleAddresses = IProduct(product).getRuleAddresses();
        uint256[] memory ruleBitmaps = new uint256[](ruleAddresses.length);

        for (uint i = 0; i < ruleAddresses.length; i++) {
            ruleBitmaps[i] = IRule(ruleAddresses[i]).getConditionBitmap();
        }

        bytes memory encryptedUserHash = registry.getEncryptedFHEHash(user);

        return verifier.verifyUserAgainstRules(encryptedUserHash, ruleBitmaps);
    }
}

```

## 🧪 Zama Verifier Pseudocode

```solidity
fn verify_user_against_rules(encrypted_hash: EncryptedBits, rules: Vec<PlainBits>) -> EncryptedBool {
    let mut rule_passes = vec![];

    for rule in rules {
        let passes = fhe_check_conditions(encrypted_hash, rule);
        rule_passes.push(passes);
    }

    // Return true only if all rules pass
    fhe_and_all(rule_passes)
}
```

## 🔁 Flow: RWA Trade and Redemption

### Trade Flow (e.g., USDC → Stock X):

1. User initiates swap on Uniswap v4
2. Hook queries `RulesEngine` to check compliance
3. `RulesEngine` sends encrypted hash + rules to off-chain FHE verifier
4. If verified → swap proceeds

### Redemption Flow (Stock X → USDC):

1. User initiates redemption request
2. Off-chain verifier checks user eligibility via FHE
3. If approved:
   - RWA tokens are **burned**
   - USDC is **minted atomically** to the user’s wallet via Circle

This atomic process ensures that privacy and compliance are enforced **without delay or manual review**.
